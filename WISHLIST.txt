Pre-virtualization:
  - Look for basic blocks that briefly enable and then disable interrupts,
    and arrange to deliver interrupts synchronously in these places.
  - We lose the flags bits while emulating sensitive instructions.
    After each sensitive instruction, see if there is a read hazard on the
    flags bits.  If so, then be sure to preserve the flags bits during
    the emulation.
  - Track the input labels, and ensure that we never generate an overlap
    label, especially when handling sensitive instructions within macros.

Aspect programming:
  - Add code to be executed at key junctions of C output, such as checking
    for interrupts when returning to guest.
  - For boundary functions, prepend assembler, and insert assembler immediately
    before the ret instruction, to impedance match the
    C calling conventions; thus we needn't use hand-written trampolines, and
    we can remove this code from the inline points.
  - Also prepend instructions to prepare the boundary-point parameters, i.e.,
    the burn registers stack frame.
  - Remove function prologs and epilogs to create our own empty functions,
    where the C calling convention needn't be obeyed.
  - How to associate functions with the code weaving?  Perhaps by function
    name.
