[ Mercurial Integration ]

We distribute the Afterburner projects via the CVS system, because CVS performs well as a central repository.  It is outclassed by Mercurial (Hg) for normal
revision control activities, and we recommend that you use Mercurial for
maintaining your local source tree.  Both Mercurial and CVS comfortably
live together in the same working directory.
