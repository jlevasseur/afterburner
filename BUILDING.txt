Prerequisites:
1.  You need the Antlr C++ runtime, available from www.antlr.org in the 
    antlr source distribution.  The Antlr configuration script and build
    system will automatically install the C++ runtime.  We expect that
    you install the C++ runtime so that we can find antlr, antlr-config,
    the Antlr include files, and the Antlr libraries.
2.  A recent version of g++.  If you have lots of compile errors from the
    C++ source files, then you probably need to upgrade your g++.

To build, simply execute make.  If you want object files and output to
go to a different directory (e.g., build), then execute 'make O=build'.
