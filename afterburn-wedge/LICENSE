The majority of the code in the Afterburn project has been developed by a 
collaboration of people from:
1.  The System Architecture Group at the University of Karlsruhe,
    http://l4ka.org
2.  The DiSy Group at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 
    cooperation with the National ICT Australia (NICTA),
    http://www.disy.cse.unsw.edu.au/
and is licensed under the two-clause BSD license (see below).

This project also includes code from other projects, usually licensed
under the GPL.  The proper location for the third-party code is in
the contrib subdirectory.  It is our goal to ensure that GPL-licensed
code is only used for the build process, and thus unable to restrict
the use of the final runtime binary.
