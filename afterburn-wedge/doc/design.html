<h1>Guidelines For Engineering and Architecting</h1>

To achieve the goals of high quality code, and design that reflects the output
of researchers advancing the state of the art (not engineers following the foot
steps of other pioneers), we need to articulate standards for engineering
quality and distributed design.

<p>
In distributed design, it is expected that contributors can architect
and build components mostly on their own.  But it would become a
nightmare without standards, and chaotic without understood goals.


<h2>Confidence</h2>

This project requires architecture and coding principles that inspire
confidence in the code.  A problem with para-virtualization is that it modifies
the source operating system, and merges together the coding conventions of two
different developer communities.  Consider Linux, where the developer community
prides itself in quality development through massive testing and peer review.
The results usually attest to the quality, and users expect that Linux runs
without bugs.  But transformed into L4Linux or XenoLinux, it escapes the
original developer community, and a secondary developer community modifies the
<em>foundation</em> of the OS.  The second developer community doesn't apply
the same principles of quality control.  Can you trust the result?  I don't.
For inspiring confidence, L4Linux's design is fundamentally flawed.  Its
software quality relies on engineering talent, and not provably correct code
transformations.

<p> We must choose an alternative route, which leverages the code quality of
the first developer environment, and applies transformations that maintain the
code quality.  The transformations should be of a nature that they are easily
proven to be correct (formally or practically).  Likewise, where we augment the
original code, it must be accomplished in an innocous manner, and must be kept
<em>simple</em>.  The rule of thumb is simplicity (but of course performance
often trumps simplicity ...).

<p> Thus this project has chosen certain strategies to raise confidence.
Examples: <dl>

<dt>C++</dt> <dd>We use modularized C++.
C++ performs just as well as C, but has
many software engineering advantages.</dd>

<dt>Type safety</dt> <dd>Use the
compiler to achieve static type checking, which is easily seen by the lack of
<code>printf()</code>.  <code>printf()</code> is a large source of bugs; it is
bad design, and has no place in this project.</dd>

<dt>Dynamic memory</dt>  <dd>This project fundamentally lacks dynamic memory.
Typical C++ programs liberally use <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>.
We aren't writing a typical C++ program, but one which should inspire
confidence.  Dynamic memory would add a serious amount of complexity to the
project, especially since we lack an environment that provides guaranteed
access to dynamic memory.  We know our resource requirements up front, and if
not, can provide for thresholds.  Some of the thresholds will be the number of
processors and emulated devices.  Note that the industry has many successful
programs written without dynamic memory, including many console games
(for example, the Playstation 1), and all Fortran programs.  </dd>

</dl>


<h2>Product</h2>

Keep in mind that we will eventually release this code as a product.  Try
to minimize side-ways work, and write the code with high quality from
the start.  As an example, under POSIX, it is in violation of the API to
invoke a system call without checking the error code.  To conform to the
API, you must check for <code>EINTR</code>.  For example, <xmp>
  do {
    result = write( fd, buffer, size );
  } while( (result == -1) && (errno == -EINTR) );
</xmp>


<h2>Pass-by-Reference</h2>

The primary CPU objects are accessed via C++ references, not pointers.  It
is an experiment of mine, and I'm not yet sure I'm happy with the 
technique.  It has the advantage of avoiding invalid pointers.  But,
compared to pointer syntax, it lacks visual feedback to suggest the
scope of side effects to a variable.
<p>

The primary mistake to make with references is to copy the structure into
another variable, rather than using another reference.  In the case of the CPU
objects, copying the CPU structure is likely the wrong intention.

<p>
The following two statement blocks are not equivalent:
<xmp>    extern cpu_t &get_cpu();

    cpu_t &cpu = get_cpu();
    cpu.disable_interrupts();

    cpu_t cpu = get_cpu();
    cpu.disable_interrupts();
</xmp>

<h2>Preprocessor</h2>

Minimize use of the preprocessor.  The preprocessor raises the difficulty
of applying source code transformation and analysis tools.  (Have you
wondered why many class browsers first require a compilation stage to
extract the class hierarchy?)
<p>
Rather than declare CPP constants, use C++ enumerated types, or constants.
The C++ alternatives have the advantage of namespaces, and thus
modularity.
Additionally use C++ templates and inlined functions.  These are easy
to analyze with tools, as opposed to CPP macros.


<h2>Device Modeling</h2>

Devices have too many options, and more than an OS will use.  When writing a
device model, you will likely only support the features used by our guest
operating systems.

<p> Please, to avoid nasty debugging sessions at later times, implement
assertions or error checks for attempts by a guest OS to use the device
features that you have not implemented.
