// NOTE: Xen's interface to the domain controller has a massive race condition,
// which is especially nasty since debug code may try to send a message while
// other code is sending a message.  Unfortunately we have to live with it.
// XenoLinux disables interrupts to avoid races, but that isn't really good
// enough either.  To make this a nice reentrant interface, one should add a
// bit to the control_msg_t that indicates who owns the field, and transfer
// ownership of the message via this bit, and use a cmpxchg on the indices.
// Currently ownership is transferred by incrementing the indices, which isn't
// reentrant.

// NOTE: Producer indices increment indefinitely as opposed to using
// modulo arithmetic.  They are masked to convert into a valid index.
